		//This case is very very unusual but necessary for maximum robustness.
		//It may seem redundant since we did a similar check at the top.
		//We had 2 choices -
		// a) remove the RLocks and just have 1 Full lock to cover this entire method.
		// We would then not need to cater for this case at all since we already did an existence check at the top.
		// b) The other is this current option.

		// Option a is not best because Full Locks slow down code more than ReadLocks. They are only necessary if you are writing to the map.
		// Since the majority of time we'd be checking for existence, rather than setting the newContext, it is better to use a ReadLock.
		// Now since we decided to use ReadLocks, then in between the mutex.RUnlock() and mutex.Lock() leaves a case where 2 concurrent goroutines
		// could believe that a context hasn't yet been created. They both want to create the new context. The Full Lock only allows that to happen
		// one at a time, despite both goroutines wanting to create it. That means the first goroutine will create a new context and the second one
		// will again create a new context.
